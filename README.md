# ZooStructuralTracker

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This program uses structural programing in order to organize a list of animals by their tracking numbers, and can be added to and removed from by the user.
This code is slightly dependant on user input for spelling and grammatical mistakes, however the formatting is all automatic and is editable by the user.
This could easily be enhanced with a GUI, and also could be expanded for more limited input, perhaps taking all input from a menu to prevent user error.
Much of this code was challenging, while learning about stringstreams, swapping between variable types in order to validate input, and formatting output.
However, my biggest takeaway from this project has been the ability to learn on the fly and adapt and learn new techniques in order to solve problems.
Careful care was taken to write this code as simply as possible, as well as to comment on any code that may have been misconstrued.
